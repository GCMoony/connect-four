# Connect Four
This is my take on re-creating the Connect Four (or any 4 piece in a row) game.

## What needs to be done
Currently, I need to work on the following:
* Score Keeping
* Game win / tie logic
* Maybe implement [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/)? (I'll definitely need to learn a bit more about it!)

## Access the game here!
